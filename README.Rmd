## About the project
OPEN DATA - OPEN SCIENCE - DATA SCIENCE
We must discover the patterns hidden behind numbers in matrices and arrays. We are not afraid of coding, recoding, programming, or modelling. We want to visualize, analyze, interpret, understand, and communicate. These are the core themes of Open Data Science (Open Data - Open Science - Data Science). And this course is THE course for learning these skills.
