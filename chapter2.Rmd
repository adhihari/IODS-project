# Structure of the data
str(students2014)

# so it has "gender" column as Factor and "age" and "points" columns as integer, rest of the columns are numeric.

# Dimension of the data

# "gender"   "age"      "attitude" "deep"     "stra"     "surf"     "points"  

# Lets visualize the attitude versus points and colors are given based in gender
# initialize plot with data and aesthetic mapping
